# Natours Application is ready!!!

Created with Node.js, Express.js, Mongodb, Mongoose in Jonas Schmedtmann's course on Udemy.com

You can do the following actions on the Natours website:

- log in and signup with email
- upload your photo
- update passwords and emails

I added following additional features to the project:

- Implement nested booking routes: /tours/:id/bookings and /users/:id/bookings
- Allow users add a review directly on the website
- Showing “Book tour now” button different to in different situations
- Implement the "My Reviews" page, where all reviews are displayed.
- Implement the logic that a user can delete and edit review
